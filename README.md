# Data-Science-and-Public-Policy

## Semester-long graduate school class, taken at Johns Hopkins University - weekly assignment descriptions below.


Lesson 1: Data Science for Public Policy Introduction and Overview

This lesson places data science in context as a profession, including how it connects with related fields and with traditional methods used for policy evaluation. It also gives a brief overview of the course content.

Lesson 2: Supervised Learning: A Decision Tree Example

This lesson is a case study that uses a decision tree to model the impact of health care indicators on community outcomes.

Lesson 3: Data Wrangling: It Has to Be Done

This lesson is an overview of the types of tasks required to prepare data for analysis and basic descriptive statistics.

Lesson 4: Exploratory Data Analysis through Visualization

This lesson is an introduction to bar charts, histograms, and scatterplots in R.

Lesson 5: Public Policy Questions and Data Science

This lesson makes the connection between policy questions and data science.

Lesson 6: Feature Selection: How to Think About it Effectively

Readings this week are on feature selection and feature engineering and how to identify features that are useful for predictive analytics.

Lesson 7: Inviting Data to the Dance with a Query

A demonstration of how queries are used and how standard query language (SQL) can facilitate the work of a data scientist.

Lesson 8: Moving to Prediction: Interpreting the Results of a Decision Tree

This lesson covers how to use training data and test data and how to interpret the results of a decision tree to capitalize on the predictive capacity of this type of model.

Lesson 9: Outlier Detection: One of These Things is Not Like the Others

This lesson focuses on outliers â€“ how they are defined, how they are detected, and how outlier detection is used in a real world setting.

Lesson 10: Unsupervised Learning: Clustering

This module is an introduction to unsupervised learning

Lesson 11: Hierarchical Clusters and K-Means Clusters

This lesson focuses on the specific aspects of hierarchical, k-means, and k-mediods cluster analysis. The demographic characteristics of neighborhoods in Baltimore are used as an example of how cluster analysis is used to identify similarities among cases.

Lesson 12: Select Your Question

This module is a synthesis of the information learned about data science and public policy. It focuses on the application of data science methods to public policy questions. It also includes a reading that covers the basic processes used in text mining including frequency analysis and text classification.
